<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
   	Le projet à pour but de nous faire découvrir les VxLANS.
		Nous avons créé et configuré des topologies de VxLANS sur GNS3

### Technologies used

* GNS3
* Docker
* Wireshark

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## What is EVPN ? 
EVPN is the technologie that create a communication beetween two Layer2 networking separated between à Layer3 network. It uses the BGP protocol wich connects VTEPs generated by the VxLANs protocols (tunneling protocol) on the leaf (wich are our swich routers here).

In an EVPN network, iBGP is used to exchange MAC addresses between the different PE (Provider Edge) routers in the network. These MAC addresses are used to build the Ethernet segment routing tables that are used to forward Layer 2 traffic across the network.

## Why do we need OSPF ? 
In summary, the OSPF underlay routing protocol in an EVPN IBGP deployment is used to provide IP-based connectivity between the PE routers, which allows them to exchange BGP EVPN routes containing information about the MAC and IP addresses associated with the customerVLANs that are being transported over the EVPN overlay network.

## What is GNS3 ? 
GNS3 consists of two software components:

The GNS3-all-in-one software (GUI) : client interface to set up and see the device’s architecture
The GNS3 virtual machine (VM) : where to run the typologies

Typologies : devices architecture setup

So, When you create topologies in GNS3 using the all-in-one software GUI client, the devices created need to be hosted and run by a server process. You have a few options for the server part of the software:

Local GNS3 server
Local GNS3 VM
Remote GNS3 VM


### Prerequisites

- You have to have GNS3 installed on your environment
- You have to have Wireshark or any packet analyzer installed
- You have to pull the busybox official image from busybox
- You have to create the image fr/routing from the Dockerfile present in P1

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On part 2 and 3 : 

- 1) Import your topology in GNS3
- 2) Execute the start routeur and start host scripts
- 3) Start all the devices on GNS3, ping the machines then check if the packet is send with Wireshark
